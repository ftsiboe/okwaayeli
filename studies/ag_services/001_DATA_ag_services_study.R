#  DATA and SETUP - AGRICULTURAL SERVICES STUDY 
# =============================================================================
#  General Description:
#  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  This script prepares analysis-ready data for the agricultural services study within the
#  okwaayeli project. It:
#    - Initializes a study-specific environment (folders, paths, metadata),
#    - Loads harmonized farm/household and agricultural services modules,
#    - Merges them at the household-farmer level,
#    - Restricts the sample to relevant GLSS waves,
#    - Saves both the processed study dataset and the study environment object
#      to disk for downstream analysis.

# ---- Housekeeping: clear workspace and run garbage collection
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE)); gc()              

# ---- Rebuild package documentation (if this is part of a package) 
# This calls roxygen2 via devtools to regenerate .Rd docs and NAMESPACE.
devtools::document()                         

run_only_for(id = 8, allowed_jobnames = "run_all")

# ---- Define study name and initialize study environment
project_name <- "ag_services"

# study_setup() is assumed to:
#   - create / verify directories,
#   - define paths (e.g., wd$home, wd$data, wd$output),
#   - and return a list-like "study_environment" object
#     containing configuration for this specific project.
study_environment <- study_setup(project_name = project_name)

# ---- Load harmonized household / farmer-level data
# Wrapper that downloads (via piggyback) and caches Stata .dta files from
# the okwaayeli GitHub repo, then reads them with haven.
farmer_data <- get_household_data("harmonized_crop_farmer_data",force = TRUE)

ag_services_data <- get_household_data("harmonized_ag_services_data",force = TRUE)

# ---- Merge farmer and agricultural services data at the household-member level
# Merge keys:
#   - Surveyx : survey round 
#   - EaId    : enumeration area
study_data <- dplyr::inner_join(
  farmer_data,
  ag_services_data,

# ---- Restrict to relevant survey rounds and drop certain variables
study_data <- study_data[
  study_data$Surveyx %in% c("GLSS5","GLSS6","GLSS7"),
]

# ---- Attach raw data to study environment (potential issue)
study_environment$study_raw_data <- study_data

# ---- Save study environment object
# Save the entire study environment configuration (paths, metadata, etc.)
# for reproducibility and to simplify subsequent scripts.
